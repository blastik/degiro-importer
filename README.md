# DeGiro Importer for Wealthfolio

A [Wealthfolio](https://wealthfolio.app) addon that imports your DeGiro account
statement CSV into Wealthfolio activities.

---

## Features

- Imports **buys, sells, dividends, deposits, withdrawals, fees, and taxes**
- Handles DeGiro's Dutch-locale CSV format (European numbers, `DD-MM-YYYY` dates)
- Aggregates **partial fills** by Order ID with weighted-average price
- Merges broker **transaction fees** into the parent trade
- Skips noise: cash sweeps, money market fund ticks, ISIN renames
- **Symbol mapping step**: auto-searches each ISIN via your configured market
  data provider and asks you to confirm the ticker before importing
- Timestamps interpreted as **Europe/Amsterdam** time (CET / CEST)
- Saves ticker mappings per account so repeat imports skip the confirmation step

## Installation

Requires **Wealthfolio 3.6.2 or newer**. Use release 1.0.x for older versions.

   [Releases](../../releases/latest).

## Usage

**Export from DeGiro**

**Import into Wealthfolio**

1. Open the **DeGiro Importer** addon from the Wealthfolio sidebar.
2. Upload the CSV file.
3. On the **Map symbols** step, review the auto-suggested ticker for each ISIN.
   - A single unambiguous match is confirmed automatically.
   - Multiple matches show a suggestion chip — click **✓** to accept or **✕**
     to skip (the ISIN will import as a custom asset).
   - Use **Accept all** to confirm all pending suggestions at once.
   - You can also type a ticker manually in the search box.
4. On the **Review activities** step, select the destination account.
